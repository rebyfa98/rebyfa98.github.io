**UPDATE [07/22]:** I graduated in Data Science from the University of Pisa, with a thesis on feature selection and estimation in sparse function-on-function regression settings!

**UPDATE [06/27]:** Our paper on the analysis of venture capital investments with tools from network science and functional data analysis has been published on Applied Network Science. [Check it out!](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-022-00482-y)
