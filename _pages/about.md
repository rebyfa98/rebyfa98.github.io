## About me

Currently, I am an M.Phil. student (first-year Ph.D. courses) in *Statistics and Computer Science* at Bocconi University, Milan. I have also been an Honors student in *Economics* at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa.

## Updates

**UPDATE [2023/03/28]:** The paper introducing `FAStEN`, our efficient algorithm for feature selection and estimation in functional regressions, is available as a preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14801)

**UPDATE [2023/03/22]:** I graduated in Economics and Management from Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa, with a thesis on the analysis of bibliographic data of publications in genome research, exploiting networks and functional data. This concludes my journey as a Honors student at Sant'Anna!

**UPDATE [2022/12/09]:** I am going to give a contributed talk on `FAStEN` at [ICSDS 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/icsds2022/home?authuser=0) later next week. [Here](https://testalorenzo.github.io/files/FAStEN_poster.pdf) you can also find a poster on it!

**UPDATE [2022/08/26]:** Our Climate Repository Project has a new dashboard to navigate through the available data. [You can find it here!](https://climaterepo.streamlitapp.com/)

**UPDATE [2022/07/22]:** I graduated in Data Science from the University of Pisa, with a thesis on feature selection and estimation in sparse function-on-function regression settings!

**UPDATE [2022/06/27]:** Our paper on the analysis of venture capital investments with tools from network science and functional data analysis has been published on Applied Network Science. [Check it out!](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-022-00482-y)
