## About me

Hi! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in *Statistics* at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html), where I am working with [Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla](https://arun-kuchibhotla.github.io/) and [Gonzalo Mena](https://gomena.github.io/).

<!-- I come from [Torre de' Roveri](https://testalorenzo.github.io/images/tdr.jpg), a small and beautiful town on the foothills of the Orobie Mountains, Italy.
