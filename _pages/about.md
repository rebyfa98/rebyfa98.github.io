Currently, I am a M.Phil. student (first year PhD courses) in Statistics and Computer Science at Bocconi University. I am also a Honors student in Economics at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies.

**UPDATE [10/08]:** I am going to take part in [ICSDS 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/icsds2022/home?authuser=0) later this December, by presenting a poster on FAStEN, our efficient algorithm for feature selection and estimation in functional regressions!

**UPDATE [08/26]:** Our Climate Repository Project has a new dashboard to navigate through the available data. [You can find it here!](https://climaterepo.streamlitapp.com/)

**UPDATE [07/22]:** I graduated in Data Science from the University of Pisa, with a thesis on feature selection and estimation in sparse function-on-function regression settings!

**UPDATE [06/27]:** Our paper on the analysis of venture capital investments with tools from network science and functional data analysis has been published on Applied Network Science. [Check it out!](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-022-00482-y)
