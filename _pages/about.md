Currently, I am an M.Phil. student (first-year Ph.D. courses) in *Statistics and Computer Science* at Bocconi University, Milan. I am also a Honors student in Economics at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa.

**UPDATE [12/09]:** I am going to give a contributed talk on FAStEN, our efficient algorithm for feature selection and estimation in functional regressions, at [ICSDS 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/icsds2022/home?authuser=0) later next week. [Here](https://testalorenzo.github.io/files/FAStEN_poster.pdf) you can also find a poster on it! 

**UPDATE [08/26]:** Our Climate Repository Project has a new dashboard to navigate through the available data. [You can find it here!](https://climaterepo.streamlitapp.com/)

**UPDATE [07/22]:** I graduated in Data Science from the University of Pisa, with a thesis on feature selection and estimation in sparse function-on-function regression settings!

**UPDATE [06/27]:** Our paper on the analysis of venture capital investments with tools from network science and functional data analysis has been published on Applied Network Science. [Check it out!](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-022-00482-y)
