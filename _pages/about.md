## About me

Hi! I am going to start my Ph.D. in August 2023. I have been an Honors student in *Economics* at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa, where I was supervised by Profs. [Francesca Chiaromonte](https://sites.psu.edu/chiaromonte/) and [Andrea Mina](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/andrea-mina). I come from [Torre de' Roveri](https://testalorenzo.github.io/images/tdr.jpg), a small and beautiful village on the foothills of the Orobie Mountains, Italy.
